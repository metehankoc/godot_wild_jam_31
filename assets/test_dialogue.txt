Caesar
Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what’s her name?
Peeta
Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t know I was alive until the reaping.
Peeta
Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to.
Caesar
She have another fellow?
Peeta
I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her,
Caesar
So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t turn you down then, eh?
Peeta
I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning...won’t help in my case,
Caesar
Why ever not?
Peeta
Because...because...she came here with me.
